// Browser QA for the QUEUED TAIL. Two things live here:
//  · SPACING — successive queued (optimistic) user bubbles must carry the same STEP rhythm as any other
//    pair of messages.
//  · THE PUSH-NOW CONTROL — the ↑ that appears left of a queued bubble on hover and preempts the turn
//    standing in front of the queue. It needs exactly what this fixture already sets up: `runtime:
//    "running"` on a claude thread plus queued bubbles. `deliveryId`s are set so the bubbles are also
//    UNQUEUEABLE, which is the real-app shape and the only way to see that the hover lift still fires
//    from the group rather than the bubble.
// Both surfaces that render the queued tail are mounted — the drawer (ThreadView/ChatView) and the
// queue card (TodosView) — because the pinned queued group is built separately in each.
