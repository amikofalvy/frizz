// MOCKUP SHEET — ONE SEND FOR ANSWERS AND A STEER.
//
// Not shipped UI and not a test. The maintainer, 2026-10-10: "We need to drop the send answers button
// and instead have it such that you send in your answers using the up arrow button in the bottom right
// of the prompt box. It's very annoying to me that I can't send my answers and submit an additional
// steer at the same time, so we need to unify them. […] just have it be a big white button […] say
// 'Steer' on it. There should be a dropdown on the right that lets you change it to [Queue]. [Queue]
// just means that Frizz maintains that in memory until the agent comes to rest, and then it pushes it.
// There's force steer, I guess, so there are three options there. Maybe it's just actually queue and
// steer initially. We should also have the placeholder text change if there are already some answers
// that have been filled out." Then: "The button should turn white as soon as any answers are filled
// out. Basically, mock this all up."
//
// ROUND TWO, the same day, on the first sheet (a button that read Steer or Queue): "I kind of think the
// button should always say 'Send', no matter what, and the user can hit the dropdown to change it
// between the values. Send as steer / Send to queue / Send as force steer. But the button should always
// say 'Send', which also is broad enough to encapsulate the fact that it may also be sending question
// answers." So the word never changes, the caret is always there, and the three ways to send are the
// menu's three rows. What says which row is ticked, with the menu shut, is the placeholder.
//
// WHAT IS TRUE TODAY (read from the code on 2026-10-10, so the sheet can say what is new):
//   · A typed message to a working agent is already a steer: `rpc.followUp` hands it to the provider at
//     once (the Claude SDK reads it at its next step, Codex takes a `turn/steer`). An ACP agent cannot
//     be steered; its bridge queues the message behind the running turn.
//   · ⌘/Ctrl-Enter is already the forced send (`interrupt: true`), on Claude threads only.
//   · NOTHING holds a typed message until the agent rests. The nearest thing is the scheduler's wake
//     outbox, which is what carries registered answers: `answerQuestions` stores them and delivers at
//     rest (or after 10m of a running turn). So today answers queue and typed text steers, and
//     "Send answers" reads only the cards — the prompt box's draft is not part of it.
//
// Every frame is the REAL Message renderer, the REAL RegisteredQuestionCard / SettledQuestionCard on one
// useRegisteredAnswering per frame, and the real WorkingIndicator, so picks, typed answers and the
// answers card behave and read as they do in the app. The prompt box is a copy of Composer's desktop
// layout with the new button in the send slot; the menu and the queued-message line are drawn here.
// Nothing is sent anywhere: a send moves the frame's own state.
