// The surface a REGISTERED question renders on — a question a worker created with the `ask` tool, which
// is a row in `thread_question` rather than a fence in a message. That is the whole difference, and it
// is the reason this file exists at all: a fenced question lives and dies with the message carrying it,
// so it vanishes from view the moment the transcript scrolls or the context is compacted, while a
// registration is still owed an answer tomorrow. So these cards do NOT ride the transcript. They sit
// where the pending-interaction stack sits — pinned above the composer, on the thread and on the board.
//
// The CARD is the shared one (QuestionBlockCard); only the plumbing is new. What a registration adds
// over the other two producers is the STATIC TREE: an option may carry follow-ups that become live only
// once that option is picked, so one registration renders as a stack of cards that grows as it is
// answered. lib/registeredQuestion.ts performs that walk; nothing here decides which nodes are live.
