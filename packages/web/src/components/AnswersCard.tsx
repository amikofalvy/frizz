// THE HUMAN'S ANSWER, on their own side of the conversation. Three different acts compose the message
// this renders — answering a ```question fence, answering a native ask, and answering a question the
// worker REGISTERED (`mcp__frizz__ask`) — and all three write the one wire form `parseAnswersCard`
// reads, so all three land here rather than in three shapes of bubble.
//
// It lived inside ChatView until 2026-08-27, when the registered path needed it too: that path's answer
// is stored on the server and DELIVERED a moment later, so the seconds in between have to draw the same
// card from the same bytes (RegisteredQuestionStack, board.answersInFlight) or the answer visibly
// disappears and comes back.
