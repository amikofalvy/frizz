// THE prompt box for a registered thread — the single block every "steer this thread" surface renders.
// The <Composer> leaf was already shared; the ~14 lines AROUND it were not, and the queue card's copy had
// silently drifted: it never intercepted the `/login` / `/logout` aliases, so typing `/login` into a cue
// card injected the literal string into the running worker's stdin while the same keystroke in the drawer
// opened the sign-in modal. Everything that must not diverge now lives here exactly once:
//
//   · the follow-up DRAFT key (so the queue card and the drawer are the same textarea, and a draft typed
//     in one is present in the other and survives a reload),
//   · the `/login` | `/logout` alias intercept + its SignInModal / LogoutConfirmModal,
//   · useThreadComposerControls (the model/effort footer and the backend busy fence),
//   · the {controls.status} line under the box.
//
// The two call sites keep their DELIBERATE differences as props, never as a forked tree: the padding
// wrapper (`className`), whether the running-operations reading (`above` the box, the one line of
// counts) is drawn at all, and the send itself (`submitOverride`). Everything else is identical by construction, the Goal in the rail included.
// The skills typeahead's per-thread cache, shared by BOTH composer surfaces (the drawer and the queue
// card render the same thread) so opening either only ever asks the harness once. A failure is NOT
// cached: the common failure is "the session is not running yet", and the next `/` should ask again
// once it is. Module scope on purpose — the cache outlives any one composer mount.
