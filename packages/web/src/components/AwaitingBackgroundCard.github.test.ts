// THE WATCHED-PR ROWS on the resting card. GitHub's merge box on ONE line per PR, in GitHub's own count
// words — the human has just come from there, and a second set of words for one fact is a second thing
// to learn (maintainer 2026-08-14: "We should basically have it evoke the GitHub UI that shows up for
// running versus completed checks").
//
// WHAT THESE NOW PIN IS THE ABSENCE OF DOUBLING. The row used to state green three ways — a prose
// verdict, the same verdict as counts, and a merge sentence beneath — so four PRs filled eleven lines
// (maintainer 2026-08-14: "this looks busy and shitty"). The glyph carries the verdict; the words carry
// only what the glyph cannot.
//
// SINCE 2026-10-08 THE ROW SAYS ONE FACT (watchCounterLine) and the full line below is its tooltip: the
// line was the widest status in the table (maintainer: "We need a better way to represent the PR status
// than to list them out in such a verbose way").
