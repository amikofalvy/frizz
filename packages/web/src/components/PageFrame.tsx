// THE FRAME BOTH PAGE SHELLS STAND IN: what a tab does about the SERVER it is talking to, whichever
// page it is showing. The app has two shells — the board (App.tsx, the Console included) and the
// full-screen thread page (StandaloneThreadPage.tsx), which sits outside the board's layout — and all
// of this lived in App.tsx alone until 2026-10-13. So a tab on `/thread/<slug>/full` did not follow a
// restart: no overlay while the server was down, and after "Update & restart" it kept running the old
// bundle against the new server, because the reload onto a new build was the board's. Cold-loaded
// there it also never raised a desktop notification, because the setting those are gated on was
// mirrored onto the store by the board and by nothing else.
//
// Both shells render THROUGH this component now: it is their root element, so neither can have the
// overlay without going inert under it and deaf to Escape, or follow the supervisor without mirroring
// the setting.
// PageFrame.guard.test.ts fails when the overlay is mounted, or the mirror written, anywhere else, and
// pageFrame.e2e.test.ts drives both shells through a restart on a real stack. Something a tab owes the
// server on every page belongs here. (The all-projects grid is not one of the two and has never
// followed a restart.)
