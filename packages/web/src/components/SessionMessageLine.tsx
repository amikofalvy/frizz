// A MESSAGE FROM ANOTHER THREAD — one top-level session's `SendMessage` into this one, most often the
// coordinator thread that spawned it steering its work.
//
// It reached the chat as an ordinary user turn whose text was Claude Code's raw wrapper, so it rendered
// in the human's own right-justified bubble with `<cross-session-message from="uds:/tmp/cc-socks/2908.sock"
// from-name="frizz-11" from-mode="bypass">` printed above the body (maintainer 2026-10-08: "There should
// be a link to the originating thread, and it should not look like fucking XML"). The server now
// unwraps it (`sessionPeer`, displayText = the body) and names the sending thread.
//
// AN EXPANDABLE HAIRLINE (maintainer 2026-10-09, over the card it first shipped as: "this should
// probably just be an expandable hairline"). It is the same class as a sub-agent reporting up — another
// agent reaching into this thread's turn — so it wears that divider's shape, and like the fired timer it
// keeps a body one click away, because the instruction is text nobody else in the app renders.
//
// The row is the INERT divider, not the clickable one, because it carries two affordances: the sender's
// title links to the sending thread (the in-project link opens it in the drawer — thread-links.ts
// intercepts `/thread/<slug>`; a sender in another project navigates to that board), and "Click to
// expand" toggles the body. A whole-row button would have to nest the link, which HTML forbids.
