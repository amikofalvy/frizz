// THE PHONE'S BOARD — a header, three text tabs, ONE list, and a "New thread" button.
//
// It is not a narrower desktop board. The desktop's three standing surfaces (project rail, thread rail,
// workpane) and its stack of right-hand drawers assume a viewport that can hold more than one thing at
// once; 390pt cannot, so the phone gets a two-level drill-down instead: a list of threads, and a thread.
//
// WHAT IS THE SAME, deliberately: the data. Every reading on a row comes from the same helpers the rail
// uses — `sectionThreads` for the bands, `sessionIndicatorKind` for the mark, `lastActiveLabelAt` for
// the rest time. A phone that derived its own answers would drift from the desktop the first time one of
// those rules changed. The row's second line is the phone's own reading (lib/mobileBoardRow.ts), built
// from the same ThreadView fields.
//
// WHAT IS DIFFERENT, and each of these is the maintainer's call from the mockup review (2026-08-17):
//
//   · RESTED AND ACTIVE ARE ONE BAND, called QUEUE. "Something is active until it's marked done." On a
//     screen showing eight rows, splitting them costs a tab switch to see work you already own — and
//     `sectionThreads` already returns the two together, so the merge is the absence of a split rather
//     than a new rule.
//   · THREAD MARKS ARE THE DESKTOP'S: a travelling checkbox frame for running work, with the same inner
//     symbols for shells, sub-agents and PRs. The shared renderer keeps state and motion consistent.
//   · NOTHING IN THE NAVIGATION CHROME ANIMATES. The header and tabs stay still.
//   · NO COMPOSER ON THIS SCREEN. Starting a thread is the "New thread" button; the reply box belongs to
//     a thread.
//   · AN ASK USES THE DESKTOP'S MUTED "?" — no card, no border, no tint on the row.
//
// AND FROM THE SECOND-DRAFT REVIEW (2026-09-30, scratch/mobile-simplify/v2.html § 1):
//
//   · THE BANDS ARE UNDERLINE TABS UNDER THE HEADER, not an iOS tab bar at the bottom: the bottom edge
//     belongs to the thumb's primary verb. Still three bands, still tabs — the 2026-08-17 call stands.
//   · THE ⋯ SHEET IS GONE. Its readings (connection, quota) open Settings now, behind a gear.
//   · ONE SECOND LINE PER ROW says what the thread wants; no provider marks, and no ⤷ sub-agent lines
//     (a live count, "· 2 agents", replaces them).
//   · THE SNOOZED TAB'S RIGHT COLUMN SAYS WHEN THE THREAD WAKES, not how long ago it rested.

// SWIPE A ROW TO TRIAGE IT — snooze or finish without opening the thread.
//
// The two verbs are the two the queue actually needs away from a desk, and they are the SAME RPCs the
// desktop header's snooze menu and check call (`setThreadSnooze`, `completeThread`), so a swipe and a
// click cannot mean different things. The swipe snoozes for the preset chosen in Settings.
//
// THE GESTURE, and the two details that decide whether it feels native rather than web:
//
//   · IT MUST NOT STEAL THE VERTICAL SCROLL. A row that follows the finger on any movement makes the
//     list impossible to scroll, so the drag only claims the gesture once the movement is DOMINANTLY
//     horizontal (|dx| > |dy| and past a small slop) — before that the browser keeps it and scrolls.
//   · ONE ROW OPEN AT A TIME. Two half-open rows read as a rendering fault, so the open row's id lives
//     in the LIST rather than in each row, and opening one closes the other.
//
// `touch-action: pan-y` tells the browser up front that this element will never want horizontal panning
// from it, which is what stops Safari from starting a back-navigation swipe on the same drag.
