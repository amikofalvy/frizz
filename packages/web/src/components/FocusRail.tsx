// THE FULLSCREEN PAGE'S OPERATIONAL RAIL — what is going on in this thread, listed beside the transcript
// (maintainer 2026-08-28): its sub-agents and background shells (live, or stale and saying so), the
// pull requests and timers it is watching, and the files its worker has edited.
//
// IT IS THE AWAITING CARD'S TABLE, one surface over. Every row here is the card's own row component —
// AgentRow, BgShellRow, GithubWatchRow, TimerRow, the same WaitRow for a file — in the card's own
// WaitGrid, so a watched PR reads here exactly as it reads on the card: the same checks glyph (a
// spinner while CI runs, green/red when it settles), the same count line, the same link to GitHub.
// The first cut of this rail drew its own rows with its own icons and threw the CI state away, and
// the maintainer met a PR he could not click beside a timer wearing a different clock (2026-08-28:
// "Please just spend a bare minimum amount of time trying to understand visual consistency").
//
// The one row the card does not have is a FILE: the same shape (mark · name · status · chevron),
// opening the file in the page's viewer. The list arrives on the transcript page, derived by the
// server over the whole projection — the latest window the page renders rarely holds an Edit at all,
// because a worker edits mid-effort and verifies at the end (server/edited-files.ts).
//
// THE FILES ARE A TREE (maintainer 2026-09-03), not a list: a directory row above the files it
// holds, a small indent per level, and a chain of single-child directories folded into one row the
// way GitHub's tree draws `packages/web/src` (lib/editedFileTree.ts). The flat list showed basenames
// alone and twenty-two of them read as twenty-two names from nowhere. The tree's rows lay out by FLEX
// inside one cell of the shared grid rather than as subgrid rows, because a subgrid cannot indent —
// see ROW_FLEX in AwaitingBackgroundCard — and the file rows are still the card's own WaitRow.
//
// IT REPLACES THE OPS STRIP UNDER THE PROMPT BOX while it is on screen (maintainer 2026-10-02: "it's
// already showing up in the sidebar to the right"), so it has to carry every row that strip did — or
// hiding the strip hides the row. Two had been the strip's alone: the files and links the worker SAVED
// for the human (`thread.links`, the same list the phone's ⋯ sheet calls "Files and links"), and a
// Codex thread's background execs, which reach the page through its transcript rather than the board's
// shell telemetry — merged here exactly as the strip merges them (mergeBackgroundShells).
//
// It floats on the page background and is VERTICALLY CENTERED like the sidebar, rather than pinned to
// the top — the maintainer's call on the mockup's top-anchored version. The liveness readouts that
// mockup led with (activity line, profile chips, context meter) were dropped on the same review: the
// thread header already says what the worker is doing, and the composer's own footer carries the
// profile.

// The rail's width, in px — the side pane on /full is exactly this wide while nothing covers it. 340
// rather than the mockup's 300: the card's rows were fitted at a 368px card, and at 300 a PR row
// truncated to "colinhacks/zod#…" — the one part of the ref that names the PR (2026-08-28).
