// ── ONE reader of /_frizz/control/status, for every consumer ───────────────────────────────────────────
// Three call sites used to ask the supervisor the same question on three private schedules: App's
// hand-rolled control-plane loop, the Restart Frizz button's mount probe, and the dev-build probe behind
// the worker-restart verb. Measured on the maintainer's board (2026-09-04) they fired at t+58ms, t+61ms
// and t+63ms of ONE navigation — three of the ~11 RPCs starting within 5ms of each other, into a browser
// HTTP/1.1 pool of six, in the burst that left a threadTranscript reporting `stall: 1978ms` before it was
// ever put on the wire.
//
// Each wanted the answer for its own reason, so none of them could simply be deleted; they share the
// query instead. react-query folds concurrent observers of one key into a single in-flight request, and
// re-arms every observer's refetch timer from the same update — so the poll stays ONE request per
// cadence however many surfaces read it, and a fourth caller costs nothing.
//
// Cadence is the union of what the old callers wanted: gentle at rest, prompt across a handoff (the
// window where the overlay is up and the operator is watching), plus the wake event that any accepted
// control action dispatches.

  // period has nothing to add: the poll is already asking on schedule.
