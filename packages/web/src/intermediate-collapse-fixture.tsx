// Browser QA for the higher-level "intermediate logs collapse" in the queue card (QCard).
//
// ONE FOLD PER RUN. A run is [what re-invoked the agent → the prose it rested on]; the human's ask opens
// the first one, and every REST and every scheduler WAKE cuts a new one — so every message the agent
// rested on survives the fold, whether or not anything narrates what resumed it. Within a run the card
// shows the TEXT ONLY of its
// opening and closing messages, and everything else — the fully-hidden middles, the tool bands batched
// into those two, and any calls made after the closing prose — collapses behind that run's own HAIRLINE
// DIVIDER (the transcript's WakeDivider chrome: the stacked-chevron ChevronsUpDown glyph, the tool-call
// count, and "Click to expand"). So a card reads: pinned ask → narration → fold → where it landed →
// ⟨why it woke⟩ → narration → fold → where it landed → … Clicking is one-way and card-wide: every run's
// full log renders at once and all the dividers unmount.
//   ?variant=heavy   (default) a user ask + an opening narration (WITH batched tools) + several tool-heavy
//                    intermediate steps + a final question. First message's tools must fold into the divider.
//   ?variant=single  user ask + ONE assistant reply (no middle → NO collapse divider, control case)
//   ?variant=notools user ask + a couple of prose-only intermediate steps. NOTHING is counted (the step
//                    count was dropped), so this pins the zero-tool label: just "Click to expand".
//   ?variant=batchedends  user ask + first(narration + tools) + ONE middle step + final(summary text + a
//                         trailing tool). BOTH ends' tools fold into the divider; both texts show tool-free.
//   ?variant=questionthentool  user ask + narration + a FINAL question + a trailing TOOLS-ONLY message.
//                         Regression guard: the closing-text anchor stays on the question (chips stay live);
//                         the text-less tool message must NOT steal the anchor and hide the question. Its
//                         call folds into the run's divider — a segment spans its WHOLE run, so work done
//                         after the closing prose is that run's work.
//   ?variant=trailingevent  user ask + intermediate steps + a FINAL question, then a sub-agent completion
//                           event AFTER it. Regression guard: the question (with answer chips) must stay
//                           visible — a trailing event must NOT pull it into the collapsed range.
//   ?variant=bgshells  three background shells launched in three SEPARATE assistant records across the
//                      collapsed run (the real shape from thread `started-three-frizz-in-quick-succession`),
//                      one of them already finished. The finished one FOLDS IN like any other call
//                      (2026-08-12) — the card is a triage surface and it is history the fold carries. The
//                      two still running leave the transcript for the ops line over the prompt box, as
//                      they do in the thread view (2026-10-09).
//   ?variant=dispatches  two sub-agent dispatches inside the collapsed run, one still running (tracked in
//                      thread.subAgents) and one resolved. Same rule as background tasks: both fold in.
//   ?variant=codexpolls a codex long-poll run: ten unpaired `Wait`/`Poll process` cards (pending +
//                      `backgroundState: "unknown"`) around ONE real detached shell. The polls fold, and
//                      the still-running shell leaves for the ops line; the variant survives as the guard
//                      that 888 poll rows can never reach the card.
//   ?variant=buriedask  a ```question in the MIDDLE of the run, with tool work and a closing summary after
//                      it. Two guards at once: the ask is lifted OUT of the collapse (a decision the human
//                      owes is not disposable chatter), and its chips are LIVE even though a newer ask is
//                      not what the card is anchored on. Pre-fix the card offered "Send answers" with the
//                      question nowhere on screen.
//   ?variant=twoasks   two ```question messages stacked with work between them, neither answered. BOTH
//                      carry live chips — the queue card used to make only the most recent one answerable.
//   ?variant=humanpast an ask the human already replied PAST (a later user turn), then more agent work.
//                      Under "Load earlier messages" the old ask must still take chips; the card's own
//                      "Send answers" action stands down until one is filled (nothing stands at the tail).
//   ?variant=prwakes  THE SEGMENTED SHAPE: one ask, then three runs separated by two real PR-watcher wakes
//                     (served `wakeSteer`, so the real FrizzWake renders). Each run must get its OWN
//                     fold, each wake its own hairline BETWEEN the run it ended and the run it caused, and
//                     the third run — one prose message over four calls — must fold on its wake alone.
//   ?variant=stackedwakes THREE SUCCESSIVE HAIRLINES with nothing between them: the middle-runs fold, then
//                      ONE delivery that carries both a CI verdict and a review comment. The two parts of
//                      that delivery must stand exactly as far apart as the fold stands from the first of
//                      them — 22px of clear space, 40px pitch. They did not: a bare fragment handed the
//                      pair to the card's own spacer walk as two messages, which in a gap-less column
//                      left only the 8px their `my-1` margins draw (maintainer 2026-08-19: "inconsistent
//                      heights on three successive airlines").
//   ?variant=priorrest TWO turns — an ask, a rest, a background wake, then a second turn ending in a
//                      question and another rest. The window reaches back to the HUMAN's ask, so both
//                      turns render; neither "Agent rested" rule may be drawn at either end.
//   ?variant=loneanswer THE REGRESSION SHAPE (2026-09-02): a one-message first answer, rest-cut middle
//                      rounds, and a one-line final run — so NO kept run folds, and the middle's first
//                      index is a rest record. Both halves of that broke: the gate saw nothing to
//                      collapse, and the divider emission keyed on an index that never renders.
//   ?variant=goalwakes THE REGRESSION SHAPE (2026-08-16): a pointed question, the ANSWER, a rest, and two
//                      more turns driven by the GOAL's own bump. Every rested message must render in full
//                      — the answer above all — each run must get its own fold, and each bump must draw
//                      its "Goal · at rest" hairline directly under the message it resumed.
//   ?variant=donetail  THE BURIED HANDOFF (2026-09-02, pullfrog `if-you-were-going-to-migrate`): the
//                      worker writes its conclusive write-up and calls `mcp__frizz__done` in one breath —
//                      ONE projected message — then appends a short pointer note, which as the run's last
//                      prose anchored the fold's close and collapsed the conclusion by default. The
//                      done-carrying message must survive (textOnly, its call folded and counted), the
//                      divider must sit ABOVE it, and the registered done card must draw at the tail.
//   ?variant=pinnedtail THE PHANTOM RUN (2026-10-02, lando `we-ve-got-to-start-working`): two real runs,
//                      then the server's PINNED copy of a Monitor still `pending` from an earlier turn,
//                      appended after the final rest. Walked as a third run, it made the run the agent
//                      signed off in a MIDDLE run and folded the whole write-up behind "1 more round".
//                      The pin must belong to no run: no middle divider, the final write-up in full, and
//                      the pinned card still drawn at the foot.
//   ?variant=loneprose / loneproseafter  A RESUMED run whose ONE prose message both opens and closes it.
//                      It folds (segmentFolds), but no row after its opening prose ever reached the
//                      divider, so its calls vanished with nothing standing in for them. The divider must
//                      draw ABOVE the lone message when the work came first (`loneprose`), and BELOW it
//                      when the agent wrote and then worked (`loneproseafter`).
//
// AND `?src=<url>` REPLAYS A REAL THREAD through the card, overriding the variant. Point it at a dump of
// the server's own `threadTranscript` reply and the card renders the actual bytes that produced a report,
// rather than a hand-built approximation of them:
//
//   curl -H 'Origin: http://127.0.0.1:9494' \
//     'http://127.0.0.1:9494/_frizz/<project>/rpc/threadTranscript?input={"slug":"<slug>"}' > /tmp/t.json
//   # serve /tmp/t.json from anywhere the fixture's origin can reach, then:
//   open '…/intermediate-collapse-fixture.html?src=http://127.0.0.1:8181/t.json'
//
// It accepts the RPC envelope (`{result:{messages}}`) or a bare `{messages}` / array, and runs before the
// fetch mock below so it uses the real `fetch`. This is how the 2026-08-16 collapse regression was
// confirmed fixed on the thread that reported it — a synthesized fixture cannot prove the server's own
// `boundary`/`wake` markers are the ones the walk keys on.

// form, with various collapsed tool call blocks between them, plus some hairline indicators showing why
// they were reawoken."
//

// FrizzWake rather than the parser fallback. The third run is deliberately ONE prose message with a
// pile of calls behind it: a woken run folds on the strength of its own wake hairline, which is the case
// the old single-span collapse could not fold at all.
// The `text` is built by the REAL formatter, not hand-written, because the card reads it: a first-park
