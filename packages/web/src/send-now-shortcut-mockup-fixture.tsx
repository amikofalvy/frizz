// MOCKUP SHEET — ⌘⏎ PRESSES "SEND NOW", AND THE CONTROL SAYS SO.
//
// Not shipped UI and not a test. The maintainer, 2026-10-19: "'Send Now' should also be triggerable with
// Command+Enter. That applies even if the focus is currently in the prompt box and you have nothing
// written. It should also probably show that as a shortcut. Mock it up."
//
// WHAT IS TRUE TODAY (read from the code on 2026-10-19):
//   · Send now is one quiet "↑ Send now" link under the queued messages (ChatView QueuedSendNow). A run
//     sent to the queue goes to the agent's next step on the first press; a run waiting for the agent's
//     next step is pushed through on the next (router deliverQueuedNow). It has no shortcut.
//   · ⌘/Ctrl-Enter in the prompt box is the FORCED send of the words typed there (interrupt and send,
//     Composer onInterruptSubmit). With the box empty it does nothing: the composer's `canSend` gate
//     refuses it. Outside the box it does nothing either.
//
// ROUND TWO, the same day, on candidates A–F: "I'm going to need some more permutations of this because you
// did not nail it in any of those. Try versions where it's in a keycap, but it's to the left of the Send Now
// label." So G–N all put a keycap to the LEFT of the words and vary everything else: the arrow kept or
// dropped, the cap's drawing (lipped, flat, filled), one key or two, the Return glyph, the words' underline,
// and whether the cap lifts with the words on hover. A ⌘⏎ press now presses the cap itself. Round one
// stays below them, folded, as the record.
//
// ROUND THREE, the same day: "Option I is good. Can we get a version that's like Option I? It's a flat
// keycap, but it still turns white on hover like Option N. Also, the transition animation's transition
// time needs to be much faster." So O and P are I's flat cap lifting with the words — O lifts the hairline
// to grey as N does, P turns it white with the glyphs — and every fade on the sheet drops from 150ms to
// 50ms, with a switch to compare speeds. The beat a ⌘⏎ press holds before the line goes drops from 220ms
// to 90ms. Round two folds away under it.
//
// THE BEHAVIOUR EVERY CANDIDATE SHARES: with nothing typed, ⌘⏎ presses Send now — with the caret in the
// empty box or with focus anywhere else in the thread — and does exactly what a click would at that
// moment. With words typed it keeps today's meaning and sends them now. Only the way the control shows
// the chord differs between candidates.
//
// The transcript is the REAL Message and WorkingIndicator, and the prompt box is the REAL Composer with
// its Send split button: its own Enter and ⌘⏎-with-words run unchanged, and the frame catches the empty
// ⌘⏎ the composer lets through. The Send now line is drawn here. Nothing is sent anywhere.

            Today {CHORD} only sends words typed in the prompt box; with the box empty it does nothing, and Send now under the
            queued messages has no key. In every candidate below, {CHORD} with nothing typed presses Send now — with the caret
            in the empty box or with focus anywhere else in the thread — and does exactly what a click would: a run sent to
            the queue goes to the agent&rsquo;s next step on the first press, and a run waiting for that step is pushed through
            on the next. With words typed, {CHORD} keeps today&rsquo;s meaning and sends them now.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-10 max-w-[760px] text-[13px] leading-[20px] text-muted">
            The candidates differ only in how the control shows the chord. Every frame is live: click into its prompt box and
            press {CHORD} with it empty, or type something and press Enter to queue another message. Reset puts a frame back.
