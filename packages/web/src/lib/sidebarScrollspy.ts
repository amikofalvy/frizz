// of the viewport, which meant a tall card kept the rail until it had scrolled ENTIRELY off screen —
// the reader could be looking at a full screen of the next card while the rail still marked the last
// one. The rule now is: the FIRST card that is either wholly on screen or already covering half the
// viewport, and only if no earlier card is still showing more of itself than that.
//
// The two clauses cover the two shapes a queue takes. Cards TALLER than the viewport hand over at the
// halfway point, exactly when the newcomer becomes the bigger half of the screen. Cards SHORTER than
// the viewport hand over when the previous one starts leaving, so the topmost fully-readable card
// holds the rail — which is also what makes a click-to-card landing stick, since that lands the target
// whole at the top of the screen.
//
// Geometry is the CARD ROOT, not the queue slot: the slot spans the root's bottom scroll-reserve
// margin (and until 2026-08-25 carried ~80px of inter-card gutter too), and crediting a card for empty
// space would let a card that is visually gone still count as "wholly on screen".
