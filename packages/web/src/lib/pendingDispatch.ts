// A DISPATCH THE SERVER HAS NOT SHOWN YET — the thread a prompt box just started, between the click and
// the board delta that carries its row.
//
// The prompt box used to say so with a card of its own ("Starting thread…" over the prompt's text), set
// between the box and the rail. That card took height for exactly as long as the dispatch call ran and
// then gave it back, so everything under it moved twice for one new row. Recorded on a project's
// sidebar, 2026-10-13 (three runs, a local stack whose dispatch answers in about half a second):
//
//   +13-22ms    the card mounts: the Queue label and every row move DOWN 73px
//   +485-580ms  the board delta lands first: the Running row appears UNDER the still-mounted card
//   +494-594ms  the call answers, the card unmounts: every row moves back UP 73px
//
// In the stacked layout (≤800px, the sidebar above the queue) the queue's cards made the same round
// trip. A real provider's dispatch takes seconds rather than half of one, so the rail sat shoved down
// for all of it.
//
// So the pending thread is kept HERE, where the rail can read it, and the rail draws it as the Running
// row it is about to become (StartingRow in Sidebar.tsx): one row appears at the click, and the real
// one takes its place without anything moving.
//
// THE CONSOLE'S RAIL does the same (ConsoleSidebar.tsx). Its card was taller, 81px for the project chip's
// longer prompt line, so the round trip there was 93px, in either grouping (three runs each). Grouped by
// status the row leads the Running band wearing its project's square; grouped by project it leads its
// own project's running rows, and a project with nothing on the Console opens its block at the click
// (lib/consoleBoard.ts projectBlocks) instead of when the row lands.
//
// THE FIRST-RUN FORM has no rail to draw a row in, and keeps the card: it is the one thing on that screen
// that still shows what was asked. But the form is centred in the window, so a card in flow lifted the
// heading, the status row and the box 36-37px for the length of the call. It is drawn out of flow there,
// hung under the form (DispatchForm `pendingCard="float"`). The same shape as lib/steering.ts and
// lib/optimisticArchive.ts — a hint that asserts what the server is about to report and yields the
// moment it does.
