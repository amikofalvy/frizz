  // running session cannot be moved to bypass at all (real `claude` refuses — "the session was not
  // launched with --dangerously-skip-permissions"; measured in `_live_sdk_mode_switch.mts`). So the
  // server persists the intent and kills the daemon, and the next turn cold-resumes the same
  // conversation in a process that carries the new flag. That genuinely cannot happen while a turn — or
  // a sub-agent, or a background shell — is running: the restart would kill the work.

  // (This used to say "restarting the tmux pane", and named permission-controller.ts, which inspected
  // the live TUI's composer to protect an unsent draft. Both went with the tmux transport. The GATE is
  // unchanged, because the new mechanism needs exactly the same idleness the old one did.)
  //
  // A Codex app-server row has no pane and no restart. Its change rides `thread/settings/update`,
  // which the app-server accepts MID-TURN and applies from the next turn on (verified live), exactly
  // the "it just queues up like anything else" behaviour the terminal UI gives you. Fencing it on a
  // running turn was the Claude gate leaking onto a runtime that never needed it, and the operator was
  // right that it made no sense. The server still fails closed on its own: an unreachable bridge falls
  // back to persist-only and answers "saved for the next resume".
  // An ACP thread has no permission axis at all (the agent's own CLI decides what it may do), so the
  // control never shows for it — the server refuses the RPC outright; never fence what cannot change.
