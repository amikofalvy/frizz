/** HORIZONTAL rhythm for a strip of small marks — the sibling of `iconAlign.ts`, which does the same
 *  job vertically.
 *
 *  THE PROBLEM, stated once. `gap` spaces BOXES. The eye spaces INK. In a control strip those are not
 *  remotely the same measurement, because every mark wears a different amount of dead space inside its
 *  own box, from two independent sources:
 *
 *    1. the control's padding — a 24px hover square around a 12px glyph carries 6px a side;
 *    2. the GLYPH's own inset inside its svg — lucide's `Plug` paints only 8 of its 13 box px, while
 *       `RefreshCw` paints 10 of 12 and a bordered pill paints all of its box.
 *
 *  So a strip on one uniform `gap-1.5` drew SIX DIFFERENT distances. Measured on the shipped footer
 *  (`scripts/ink-gaps.mjs`, 2026-08-05, every CSS gap 6px):
 *
 *      context meter → hourglass    10.34px ink
 *      hourglass → heartbeat        12.50px
 *      plug → restart               20.50px   ← widest
 *      restart → Snooze pill        13.00px
 *      Snooze pill → Mark as done    5.78px   ← narrowest
 *
 *  A 3.5× spread, and the maintainer read it exactly off the pixels: "the perceived distance between
 *  the plug-in icon and the restart icon is much larger than the perceived distance between the
 *  restart icon and the left side of the snooze button, both of which are much larger than the space
 *  between the context icon and the heart… I'm sure the spacing is consistent in terms of the CSS, but
 *  what matters here is the visual spacing."
 *
 *  THE FIX. Collapse each mark's layout box onto its own ink with a negative margin equal to its
 *  MEASURED dead space, then let one `gap` mean what it says. After that the container's gap IS the
 *  ink gap, for pills and bare glyphs alike, and adding a mark to the strip is a one-line change
 *  rather than a re-tune.
 *
 *  THE STRIP THIS WAS WRITTEN FOR IS GONE. The lifecycle footer went on 2026-10-05: its context
 *  reading moved up into the header's second line (ContextMeter), its goal down into the composer rail
 *  below, and snooze and mark as done into the header's action strip as bare icons on that strip's
 *  uniform 28px squares (ThreadLifecycle.tsx), where every mark carries the same box and no trim
 *  applies. Its strip gap and its last trim (the snoozed alarm clock's) went with it.
 *
 *  What remains is the composer RAIL, whose marks sit at absolute offsets rather than on a gap — the
 *  same law applied per mark: each offset is chosen so the INK between neighbours, not their boxes,
 *  keeps one distance. Every constant below is a measurement, not a taste. Re-measure — never
 *  re-guess — if a glyph, an icon size, or a control's padding changes (`scripts/ink-gaps.mjs`, and
 *  read `deadLeft`/`deadRight` off each mark). */


/** THE RAIL, right to left: send, the microphone (only where on-device dictation exists — see
 *  lib/dictation.ts), the rail action (the dispatch composer's GitHub picker), the paperclip, and the
 *  lead (the thread composer's Goal). Each is a 28px square; any of the middle marks may be absent, and
 *  the marks to its left close up.
 *
 *  What is measured is the BOX GAP between each pair of neighbours — the gap that puts their INK
 *  ~14.5px apart, given the dead space each glyph wears. The Send button is filled, so its ink is its
 *  box; the bare 15px icons carry 7–9px of empty box per side. Hover outlines do not take part in the
 *  resting rhythm. A pair missing from the table falls back to the paperclip→send gap; add the
 *  measurement rather than relying on it. */
