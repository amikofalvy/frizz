// WHICH PROJECT ICONS THIS BROWSER HAS ALREADY DRAWN — so a square that mounts again draws its icon
// at once instead of fading it in.
//
// A square starts transparent and fades its icon in on `load`, which is right the first time a picture
// arrives and wrong every time after: the grid remounts every square when it is opened, and a reload
// remounts all of them, so a picture the browser held in its cache still took ~120ms to show (the load
// event, then the 150ms fade), measured 2026-10-21 on a 12-project grid. Remembering it here lets the
// square skip both, and the browser paints the cached picture in the first frame it can.
//
// Keyed by project id and `iconVersion`, which is the picture's hash, so a changed icon is a new key
// and fades in like any new picture. The value is whether the picture fills its tile (ProjectSquare's
// `fills`), so a remembered square starts with the right fit too, instead of jumping on load.
// Kept in localStorage so it outlives a reload, and capped so it cannot grow without bound.
