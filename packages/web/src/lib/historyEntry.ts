/**
 * Did this app push the history entry the page is on, in this session?
 *
 * react-router numbers the entries it writes (`idx` in history.state): the entry a document loaded on
 * is 0, and every push counts up from there — including a push lib/router made when a thread opened.
 * So a thread page on an entry above 0 has an entry BELOW it that is ours (the board it was opened
 * from, or whatever the app showed before), and the platform's Back returns there. On 0 it arrived by
 * a cold link — a bookmark, a notification, a pasted URL — and what sits below it, if anything, is some
 * other site.
 *
 * The phone thread header's ← asks this to behave exactly like Back: pop when there is an entry of
 * ours to pop to, and only otherwise fall back to replacing the thread's entry with the board (the
 * desktop ×'s close). Replacing it always had left TWO board entries behind every ← — the board the
 * thread was opened from, and the thread's entry rewritten to it — so the next Back did nothing.
 * The same-URL entries lib/backDismiss pushes carry the router's state over, so they read the same.
 * That includes one a reload left behind with no sheet to own it, which made ← pop onto the very same
 * thread; main.tsx steps off such an entry at boot (backDismiss `stepOffStaleLayerEntries`), so the
 * entry a page sits on is the router's own and this index stays truthful across a reload.
 *
 * The board asks it too, of a `/thread/<slug>` entry it is about to settle (store resolveRoutedThread,
 * primeFullscreenReturn). In-app, that address is written only when a thread DRAWER opens (the
 * store→URL sync) and by the fullscreen collapse returning to the drawer it left, so an entry of ours
 * there was a drawer, and gets its drawer back even over the thread's own queue card. A cold one —
 * idx 0 — lands a queued thread on its card. Its own module so the store can ask without importing
 * lib/router, which imports the store.
