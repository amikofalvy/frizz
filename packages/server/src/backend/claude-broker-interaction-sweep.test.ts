// A Claude interaction that outlives its answerability must be TERMINALIZED, not left pending.
//
// The defect these pin, from a live thread: a `claude`/`agent-question` row journaled
// 2026-08-02T02:23:52Z on `https-varlock-dev-integrations-overview-can` was still `pending` a day
// later, rendering an answerable question card pinned to the tail of a transcript whose turn had long
// since moved past it. Nothing on the Claude side ever swept: `cancelForSession` was reached only from
// storage.ts (session replaced/deleted) and from the codex bridge, which retires its own on
// `turn/completed` and on a rebind onto a dead turn.
//
// Both tests drive the REAL fork/socket/daemon path with the fake CLI, because the whole question is
// what happens to the journal when a real turn ends and when a real daemon is gone — a stubbed bridge
// would be asserting the stub.

// wrote the frame, the parked turn never reached the point of consuming it, and the message sat queued

// messages for 90 minutes, and it is the ONE property a ```question fence has for free that a native ask
// does not — a fence ends the turn, so the next message is just the next message.
//
// The `ask` scenario is the right driver here (unlike the turn-ended test above): the whole point is a
// card that is genuinely holding a live turn open, which is the only state this sweep exists for.
// The other half of that rule: a message NOBODY TYPED supersedes nothing. A scheduled wake reaches the
// same `followUp`, and until 2026-10-10 it retired the card the same way — so a timer coming due, a
// schedule beat or a report held past the scheduler's mid-turn ceiling answered an open approval `deny`
// on the operator's behalf, and told a question-blocked model to "read their next message", which was
