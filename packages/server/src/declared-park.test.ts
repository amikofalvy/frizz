// THE DECLARED PARK — a thread is "awaiting background work" when it SAYS SO, naming what it waits on.
//
// The inference it replaces (does this thread happen to have something running?) is what put the resting
// card on a thread whose only background work was a dev server nobody tore down: true by the letter,
// useless as a signal.
//
// THE FENCE REGISTERS NOTHING — it is display-only, and exists so a worker can rest without being bumped
// for a handoff. A background shell already wakes its agent when it finishes, and a sub-agent's return
// re-invokes its parent, so there was never anything for frizz to arm (maintainer 2026-08-14: "Both
// subagents and background shells should be display-only here").
//
// So what these pin is the INTEGRITY CHECK: every name in the fence has to correspond to something the
// thread ACTUALLY has out right now, and everything else must fail OPEN — back to the queue, never
// parked behind a wait that does not exist. A typo is not a way to disappear from the board.
