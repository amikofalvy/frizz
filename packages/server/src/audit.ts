// ── The audit trail of high-impact board actions ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// On 2026-10-08 a board session stolen through a backdoored frizz.sh relay was used to add
// `/private/tmp` as a project, dispatch about 13 workers into it, and later remove the project with
// its data. Frizz had logged none of it: no line said a project was added or removed, that a thread
// was dispatched or messaged, whether the request came over loopback or through the relay, or which
// signed-in device sent it. Nothing could be attributed.
//
// So every action that can start work on this machine, or destroy Frizz's record of it, writes one
// JSON line here: when, what, which project and thread, whether it was refused, and WHO — the request
// origin the launcher's proxy saw (CALLER_HEADER) plus the board session it verified. Never a
// secret: a session is named by its record id (what `frizz --sessions` lists), never its cookie, and
// prompt, message and answer text are recorded as a character count and a SHA-256, never the words.
//
// Machine-wide and append-only, at `<data>/logs/audit.jsonl` (`~/.frizz/logs/audit.jsonl` on a
// legacy layout) at 0600: one file answers "what did this board do" across every project, and the
// per-run logs beside it are pruned by count and age where this one is not. Each record is also
// summarized as one line in the ordinary run log, so it is in front of whoever reads that first.
//
// AN AUDIT WRITE NEVER FAILS THE ACTION. Every failure here is caught and reported to the run log.
