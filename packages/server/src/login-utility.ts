// A restricted, short-lived provider ACCOUNT utility — the terminal behind the sign-in modal's
// primary "Sign in" action. This is NOT the agent-thread terminal: it never resumes or mutates a
// worker, inherits no project prompt, and accepts no arbitrary shell command — the pty runs exactly
// the provider's own login argv (`claude auth login`) and nothing else, spawned WITHOUT an
// intervening shell.
//
// Runs on node-pty DIRECTLY. It used to run inside a tmux pane, which was the last piece of frizz that
// genuinely needed tmux — every agent transport had already moved to the broker/app-server (pipes and
// JSON-RPC, no PTY at all), so a whole terminal multiplexer was being required at launch for one
// sign-in flow. node-pty was already a direct dependency (the /term transport uses it) and works on
// Windows through ConPTY, which tmux cannot.
//
// tmux also gave multi-viewer attach for free, so that is rebuilt here deliberately and minimally:
// ONE pty per attempt, a bounded replay buffer, and a subscriber set. Two browser tabs on the sign-in
// modal must see the SAME OAuth flow — spawning a pty per viewer would start a second one and race
// them against a single credential store.
//
// Addressing: each attempt gets an opaque, server-issued, slug-SHAPED id ("login-<16 hex>", 64 random
// bits). Being slug-shaped lets the attempt ride the existing hardened /term/<slug> transport (same
// input/output/viewer bounds) — index.ts resolves an attempt id BEFORE consulting the session
// registry, and no registry row ever exists for one, so the board/tailer/adoption never see it.
//
// Ephemerality: login output (OAuth URLs, pasted codes) lives only in this process's memory — the
// replay buffer and the bounded WS byte stream — never in a transcript, SQLite, scratchpads, or
// server logs. Teardown kills the pty AND drops the buffer on cancel, success, timeout or shutdown.

// survives — a viewer needs the current prompt, not the banner.
