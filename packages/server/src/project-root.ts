// WHAT A PROJECT IS, WITHOUT ASKING GIT.
//
// Frizz used to define a project as a Git repository: the root came from `rev-parse --show-toplevel`
// and the id from `git config --local frizz.id`. That made Git a hard requirement to LAUNCH, which
// contradicts the product's own position — Frizz has no opinion about version control — and locked
// out anyone on jj (a non-colocated repo has no `.git` at all), hg, or nothing.
//
// So the id lives in the project instead, at `.frizz/.id`, beside the scratchpads Frizz already
// writes there. Two of the four properties `git config` was buying (project-identity.ts) come free
// that way: a directory that MOVES keeps its id because the id moved with it, and an alias resolves
// to the same id because it resolves to the same directory. The other two — atomic creation under a
// race, and sub-directory equivalence — are re-earned here, by the same named lock the Git path uses
// and by the walk-up below.
//
// THE ONE HAZARD, AND WHY IT IS NOT ONE. Unlike `git config --local`, a file in the working tree can
// be committed, and two clones of that repo on one machine would then share an id. `.frizz/.gitignore`
// containing `*` removes that outright: the directory ignores ITSELF and everything under it, so
// `git add -A` cannot stage any of it (verified in a repo with no top-level .gitignore at all —
// `git status --porcelain` is empty and `check-ignore` reports the id and the .gitignore as ignored).
// Writing it is not an opinion about the user's version control, it is the ordinary convention for a
// tool's own scratch directory: `.venv/.gitignore` and `.swc/.gitignore` are exactly this file.
