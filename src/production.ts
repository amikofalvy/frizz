 * The version THIS bundle actually is, read from the package.json it ships inside.
 *
 * It used to be `process.env.npm_package_version ?? "0.0.1"`, and npm sets that variable only for
 * lifecycle scripts — NOT when a bin runs through the npx shim, which is how every real user starts
 * Frizz. So the launcher reported itself as `0.0.1` forever. Measured end-to-end against the published
 * package: a genuine 0.1.1 install served `artifactDigest: "npm:frizz@0.0.1"`, and still served
 * `0.0.1` after updating itself to 0.1.2.
 *
 * That is not cosmetic. `planRegistryUpdate(PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_VERSION, …)` compares this against
 * the registry's latest, so a permanent `0.0.1` makes every version look newer: the "already current"
 * branch below is unreachable, and Update Frizz reinstalls-and-restarts even when nothing is stale.
 *
 * `import.meta.dirname` is the bundle's own directory (`<package>/dist`), the same base `webDist` and
 * `runtimeDir` resolve from below — so this reads the package.json that was published alongside it.
 * The env var stays as a fallback for anyone launching through a lifecycle script.

Run it in the directory you want to work in. One server serves EVERY project on this machine,
each at its own /project/<name> URL, so a second run joins the one already going. Runs the
npm-resolved immutable Frizz package, then opens it in your default browser. Use frizz-dev only
for a source checkout.

Options:
  --no-app               print the URL without opening a browser
  --port <port>          request a fixed port for a new workspace server
  --sandbox              a disposable Frizz to try things in: throwaway home and project, its
                         own port, deleted when this terminal closes; credentials (gh,
                         cloudflared, Claude, Codex, the machine's frizz.sh key) are shared
  --link                 print a fresh single-use access link for the running board
  --sessions             list the devices signed in to the running board
  --sign-out <id|all>    sign one device out, or every one of them
  --status               report the board running for this project: address, pid, version
  --stop                 stop the board running for this project (running agents keep going)
  --debug                stream the full event feed to the terminal instead of the compact readout
  -h, --help             show this help


To reach the board from a phone or another machine, press R in the terminal running it: a short
walkthrough sets up a private frizz.sh name (no account needed), a custom one, a Cloudflare
Tunnel, Tailscale, or a proxy of your own, and
