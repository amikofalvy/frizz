 * running `npm-cli.js`. Three places can hold that script, in this order:
 *
 *   1. beside `npm_execpath`, which npm sets for a bin it runs itself (`npx frizz`, `npm exec`);
 *   2. beside node.exe (the Windows installer layout);
 *   3. under `../lib/node_modules` (the POSIX installer layout).
 *
 * A global bin started from a shell has no `npm_execpath`, so it gets the npm that ships with node.
 * On POSIX the bare `npm` command is the fallback, which is the behaviour before this helper existed.
 * On Windows there is no working fallback: the bare name only reaches the shim, and a swallowed spawn
 * error would end the board with a success message. So Windows throws instead. (8r4x, #32.)
