/**
 * The Node releases Frizz actually runs on, MEASURED rather than derived from dependency manifests.
 *
 * Frizz's database is `node:sqlite`, unflagged in v22.13.0 and v23.4.0. Below those the module does not
 * exist at all — the import fails with "No such built-in module" — so the floor is simply the release
 * that shipped it. Verified by running the driver's own suite (`sqlite.test.ts`) on 22.12, 22.13,
 * 22.14, 23.4, 23.6, 24 and 26: every release from 22.13 up passes it whole, and 22.12 is the only
 * failure. Anything newer than the highest line listed is assumed good.
 *
 * Hence a floor PER RELEASE LINE rather than one number: a plain `>=22.13` would also advertise
 * 23.0-23.3, where `node:sqlite` does not exist either.
 *
 * This was 22.14 until the database moved off better-sqlite3, whose prebuild is built with
 * `NAPI_VERSION=10` (available only from 22.14/23.6) while the package declared `engines: ">=22"`. On
 * an older Node that addon did not fail to load, it SEGFAULTED inside `napi_module_register_by_symbol`.
 * A built-in module has no prebuild, no ABI and no floor that can shift under a lockfile update, so
 * the migration deleted that whole class of failure — and, unusually, LOWERED the floor by a release.
 *
 * `package.json`'s `engines.node` mirrors this table and a test asserts they stay equal. They have
 * drifted twice, in both directions: `>=26` against an enforced 22.12 (an EBADENGINE warning about a
 * floor nothing checked), then `>=22.12.0` against a runtime that segfaulted there. The published
 * package ships COMPILED JS, so the source workflow's Node is never the consumer's Node.
