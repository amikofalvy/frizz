# frizz.sh incident — open to-dos (2026-10-08)

What is still owed after the 2026-09-21..10-08 compromise of the frizz.sh Workers. The account of what happened is in [`packages/relay/README.md`](../packages/relay/README.md); the machine-local evidence and reports are in the maintainer's `.frizz/threads/d178f311-c9a3-4816-85e9-f595219a1f92/` (gitignored). Nothing here is urgent in the sense of an open hole that is known: the backdoored Workers were replaced with clean builds on 2026-10-08, the implant and the `~/.zshrc` dead-drop on the maintainer's Mac are removed, and every board session is signed out. Each item below is hardening or follow-through.

## Already done (checked 2026-10-08 20:50 PDT)

- `frizz@0.13.8` and `frizz-server@0.15.17` are on npm, published from `46ab24bb`. They carry the 30-day session lifetime and the session epoch that signs out every older remote device once, and the zero-scope GitHub device flow.
- Every `@nubjs/*@0.9.4` package is deprecated (`@nubjs/types@0.9.4` is gone from npm).
- The implant's kill-switch file `$TMPDIR/log_de-0.log` exists.
- The maintainer's own board rotated its `session-key` at 2026-10-08 17:01, and it serves a private name (`kpfhl7cbp5qf4olyh2t7.frizz.sh`), not a custom one.
- Custom frizz.sh names (the GitHub-backed claim) are withdrawn from every menu and doc behind `CUSTOM_NAMES_OFFERED` in [`src/cloud.ts`](../src/cloud.ts). A name already claimed keeps renewing, because a renewal is signed by the board's keypair and never touches GitHub.

## 1. Deploy the Workers from CI — set it up once

The workflows exist ([`workers-deploy.yml`](../.github/workflows/workers-deploy.yml), [`workers-drift.yml`](../.github/workflows/workers-drift.yml)) but have no credentials, so nothing deploys and the drift alarm cannot run. Until the first CI deploy it is NOT verified that the live registrar runs `main`'s code — in particular the refusal of any GitHub token that carries a scope (`6acda883`), which matters because Frizz before 0.13.8 still sends `gh auth token` on a custom-name claim.

1. On [Frizz account API tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/dde3ec1f6b1f0a397ea82a9ed322f5ce/api-tokens), click **Create Token** → **Create Custom Token**. Name it `github-actions workers-deploy`. Permissions: Account → **Workers Scripts** → **Edit**; Zone → **Workers Routes** → **Edit**. Account resources: Include → **Frizz**. Zone resources: Include → Specific zone → **frizz.sh**. Set a TTL end date. Copy the token.
2. On the same page, create `github-actions workers-drift`: Account → **Workers Scripts** → **Read**, account **Frizz**, with an end date. Copy the token.
3. At [new environment](https://github.com/colinhacks/frizz/settings/environments/new), create `workers-deploy`. Tick **Required reviewers** and add `colinhacks`. Under **Deployment branches and tags** choose **Selected branches and tags** and add `main`. Under **Environment secrets** add `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` = the deploy token.
4. At [new repository secret](https://github.com/colinhacks/frizz/settings/secrets/actions/new), add `CLOUDFLARE_READ_TOKEN` = the read token.
5. At [notification settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications), under **System → Actions**, tick **Email** and **Only notify for failed workflows**.
6. Push `main`, then run the deploy at [Workers deploy → Run workflow](https://github.com/colinhacks/frizz/actions/workflows/workers-deploy.yml) with target `both`, and approve it.
7. Open the first [Workers drift run](https://github.com/colinhacks/frizz/actions/workflows/workers-drift.yml). It fails with `WORKERS_CI_AUTHOR is not set` and prints the CI author. Add that value as a [repository variable](https://github.com/colinhacks/frizz/settings/variables/actions/new) named `WORKERS_CI_AUTHOR`, then re-run it until it is green.

## 2. Bring custom names back (optional)

Only when custom names are wanted again.

1. Open [new GitHub OAuth app](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). Application name `Frizz`, Homepage URL `https://frizz.sh`, description `Confirms which GitHub account claims a frizz.sh name. Requests no permissions.`, Authorization callback URL `https://frizz.sh`. Tick **Enable Device Flow**, click **Register application**, copy the **Client ID**. Do not generate a client secret.
2. Set `FRIZZ_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` in [`src/github-device-flow.ts`](../src/github-device-flow.ts) to that id, and `CUSTOM_NAMES_OFFERED = true` in [`src/cloud.ts`](../src/cloud.ts). Run [`scripts/verify-claim-e2e.mjs`](../scripts/verify-claim-e2e.mjs) (its header gives the invocation) and claim one real name by hand from the R pane, then cut a shell release ([CLAUDE.md § Cutting a release](../CLAUDE.md)).

## 3. Confirm or rule out a relayed terminal past the access gate

The way the SSH key and the Cloudflare token left the Mac before 2026-09-21 is still unknown. One lead is in Frizz itself: from 2026-09-19 the maintainer's board was public as `colin.frizz.sh`, and until 2026-09-24 the relay also carried a full terminal (`/term`). A relay commit is titled "a relayed terminal forwards the visitor's identity, so the access gate stands in front of it", which suggests a window where a relayed terminal did not meet the gate. Paste this into a fresh session in this repo:

```text
Read-only investigation in /Users/colinmcd94/Documents/projects/frizz. Between the first relay commit and 2026-09-24, did a request or terminal (/term) relayed through *.frizz.sh ever reach a board without passing the access gate? Use `git log --date=iso --follow` on packages/relay/src/worker.ts, src/relay-agent.ts and packages/server/src/restart-supervisor.ts; read commits c9b5557c and e48047e9 and their neighbours; find every published frizz / frizz-server version that contained a gap (`npm view frizz time --json`, `npm view frizz-server time --json`, the version tags); and find which version ran the board at colin.frizz.sh from 2026-09-19 (~/.frizz/server-releases, logs under ~/.frizz/projects/*/logs). Report the exact window, the versions, and a proof by test or reproduction against an old build if feasible. Write the report to plans/frizz-sh-relay-terminal-gate.md. Do not open a pull request.
```

If the gap is real, every board that was public through the relay in that window is in the same position, and a security advisory for the affected versions is the next decision.

## 4. Make the relay unable to read traffic

[`plans/blind-relay.md`](blind-relay.md) is the design: the relay carries ciphertext it cannot read or forge, so whoever can deploy the Worker no longer controls every board. Not started.

## 5. The maintainer's Mac

The implant gave the attacker an interactive shell as `colinmcd94` from 2026-09-28 to 2026-10-08. A sweep can find what is left; only an erase proves nothing is.

1. Quit and reopen Ghostty (**Cmd+Q**), Cursor, Zed and VS Code, if not done since 2026-10-08 — a shell started before the `~/.zshrc` cleanup still ran the dead-drop loop.
2. Optional, before or instead of the erase: run the exhaustive sweep prompt below in a fresh session.
3. Erase and reinstall. Copy out data only — not `~/Library`, dotfiles, `~/.ssh`, `~/.claude`, `~/.frizz`, apps or `node_modules`. Then open [Transfer or Reset](x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.Transfer-Reset-Settings.extension) → **Erase All Content and Settings**, set the Mac up as new (no Time Machine or Migration Assistant restore), and rotate every credential from the clean Mac. Do not publish or deploy from this Mac until then.

```text
You are doing an exhaustive compromise sweep of this Mac (user colinmcd94) after a confirmed intrusion. Another session already removed the known footholds. Your job is to find anything that is left. Default to READ-ONLY: report first. Only an item that is clearly hostile may be neutralized, and then by MOVING it into /Users/colinmcd94/Documents/projects/frizz/.frizz/threads/d178f311-c9a3-4816-85e9-f595219a1f92/quarantine/ (chmod a-x), never by deleting. Never run a suspicious binary or script. Never contact attacker infrastructure. Never print a secret value. If you start Chrome, pass --use-mock-keychain.

Known facts (details: /Users/colinmcd94/Documents/projects/frizz/.frizz/threads/d178f311-c9a3-4816-85e9-f595219a1f92/incident.md, prong-*.md, implant-analysis.md):
- ~2026-09-21: a 2017 SSH key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.compromised-20260921) and a Cloudflare API token (~/.frizz-cf-token, path named in the public frizz .gitignore) left this disk; vector unknown. The GitHub pushes on 09-21 put an EtherHiding loader into zod, standard-schema and nub.
- 2026-09-28 05:08 PDT: a Frizz thread was dispatched to this board through the backdoored frizz.sh relay (Haiku, bypassPermissions) and ran uname/whoami/ps.
- 2026-09-28 06:26 PDT: implant "System Event.app" (Go, NPS-based RAT: shell, file read/write/timestomp, command exec, proxy, upload to Alibaba OSS) ran until 2026-10-08 11:53. The attacker had an interactive shell as this user for 10 days, so assume any file was read and anything could have been planted, with forged timestamps.
- 2026-09-28 07:45 PDT: a "SESSION_SYNC" command dead-drop went into ~/.zshrc (now removed).
IOCs to grep for everywhere (files, binaries, configs, git history): api.ubuntu-wiki.online, ubuntu-wiki, 0x8CD41b2bEc90b1799689850564658b0aa15b9A43, getDomains, t!JNxAbK7#0fo&I-, TsNFQr_LwqFj4rsw, log_de-, mix-interpreted-parliament-homes, trycloudflare.com, 64.176.203.80, 38.55.103.2, 2001:19f0:4000:2103, f272d9460b1df6bb, 0xe236330379d0c54aD5b2ef06aC714CEbdd4Ce523, 0x53ed5143, setupB64, payloadB64, __SETUP_DONE__, RUNTIME_DIR, SESSION_SYNC, /tmp/.auth, com.system.event, SystemEvent, sha256 036807450bca2dda3f2ef89bcbb907df6ef57fca9a6d57eb2d0ff8af3da37ba8 and 5ed518aaff5aebc729545b8eb223ec31927cd1bfa53169517f09cdbcc9fd5a0b.

Sweep, and record for each area: what you checked, the exact commands, and the findings.
A. Persistence: every LaunchAgent/LaunchDaemon (user and system, including hidden "." files), `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)` for jobs with no plist on disk, login items (`sudo sfltool dumpbtm`; ask the maintainer to approve sudo), cron, at, /etc/periodic and /usr/local/etc/periodic, `profiles list` (configuration profiles), system/kernel extensions (`systemextensionsctl list`), and every folder in ~/Library/Application Support, /Library/Application Support, ~/Library/Containers and ~/Applications that was created since 2026-09-20.
B. Shell and runtime hooks: every rc file for zsh/bash/fish in ~ and /etc; ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/** and every plugin; direnv .envrc files; NODE_OPTIONS/--require; Python sitecustomize.py and *.pth in every site-packages; ~/.npmrc, ~/.yarnrc*, pnpm/bun/nub configs (registry, script-shell, ignore-scripts); PATH hijacks: list every executable in each PATH dir that comes before /usr/bin and flag any wrapper for git, gh, ssh, sudo, npm, node, claude, codex or wrangler.
C. Git: `git config --global --list` (core.hooksPath, aliases, include, credential helpers, url.insteadOf); every repo under ~/Documents/projects and ~/.cache/*worktrees*: non-sample files in .git/hooks, .git/config oddities, commits since 2026-09-21 authored as "colinhacks <colinhacks@users.noreply.github.com>" or unsigned in a way that does not match the maintainer's identity, and IOC strings in working trees.
D. AI-agent surfaces (the attacker targets agents): ~/.claude/settings.json and every project .claude/settings*.json (hooks, permissions, env), ~/.claude.json and every .mcp.json (MCP servers pointing at unexpected binaries or URLs), ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, every CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/FRIZZ.md under ~/Documents/projects, every skill in ~/.agents/skills, ~/.claude/skills, ~/.codex and project .agents/skills: look for text that tells an agent to send data anywhere, run fetched code, disable checks, or that was modified since 2026-09-28 without a matching git commit. Also check ~/.codex/config.toml and Codex remote-control enrolment.
E. Editors: VS Code, Cursor and Zed extensions installed or updated since 2026-09-20, settings and tasks.json with "runOn": "folderOpen", and workspace trust settings.
F. Binaries and droppers: Mach-O files under ~ (outside node_modules, cargo/go caches and app bundles you can attribute) modified since 2026-09-27; ad-hoc-signed executables anywhere under ~ and /usr/local; executables in /tmp, /private/var/folders and ~/Library/Caches; any file whose sha256 matches the implant.
G. Network and trust: /etc/hosts, `scutil --proxy`, `networksetup -listallnetworkservices` with proxy/DNS settings per service, VPN configurations, `security find-certificate -a` in the login and System keychains for any root CA added since 2026-09-20 (a MITM root), `lsof -i -nP` for unexpected listeners or connections, running ssh -R/-L/-D tunnels, Remote Login and Screen Sharing state, ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and ~/.ssh/config (ProxyCommand, LocalCommand, Include).
H. TCC grants: read ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db (read-only sqlite) and list every app that holds Full Disk Access, Accessibility, Screen Recording, Input Monitoring or Automation; flag any not attributable to a known app.
I. Frizz itself: every project under ~/.frizz/projects: ui.db threads spawned since 2026-09-20 whose prompt the maintainer did not write (bypassPermissions, an unusual model, prompts that only run commands); claude-broker diagnostics logs; the board's remote sessions list (`/_frizz/control/sessions` on the supervisor's loopback port); and whether ~/.frizz/identity.key (the frizz.sh claim keypair) must be rotated and the name re-claimed. Report the steps; do not re-claim without asking.
J. Cloud and service accounts whose credentials were on this disk: list each credential file or keychain item (gcloud, aws, Vercel, Neon, Better Stack, Resend, Anthropic, OpenAI, Docker, 1Password CLI, Slack and Discord desktop sessions, Claude ~/.claude/.credentials.json, Codex auth.json), with a deep link to where the maintainer rotates each one. Read-only listings where a CLI is already signed in: e.g. `gcloud compute instances list` and project SSH keys in metadata, `vercel` projects and tokens, GitHub (`gh api user/keys`, `user/gpg_keys`, `user/installations`, deploy keys/webhooks/collaborators/secrets/environments of every repo the account admins), npm (`npm token list`; publishes since 2026-09-21 for every owned package via `npm view <pkg> time --json`), and Cloudflare (members, account and user tokens, workers, DNS records and their recent changes, Zero Trust tunnels, Pages, R2, email routing).
K. Persistence of access, not just code: any OAuth app or GitHub App authorized since 2026-09-21 (https://github.com/settings/applications), and active sessions on GitHub, Google, npm and Cloudflare that the maintainer should end.

Finish with: (1) a list of hostile findings and what you quarantined, (2) a list of suspicious items for the maintainer to decide, each with the evidence, (3) a rotation checklist where every item is a clickable link to the exact page plus the value or command needed, and (4) what you could not check and why. Keep the maintainer's working tree and running processes intact; never stop a process you cannot attribute to the attacker.
```
